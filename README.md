## Answer the following questions clearly:

### 1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
- **var, let, const** they are used to declaring variables. **var** is function scoped and can be redeclared. **let** is block scoped, it can change, but cannot be redeclared in the same block. **const** is also block scoped but cannot be changed.

### 2. What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
- **map(), forEach(), and filter()** these are array methods. **map()** changes each item on array and gives a new list. **forEach()** goes through each item on array but does not give back a new list. **filter()** picks a item that meet a condition and gives a new list.

### 3. What are arrow functions in ES6?
- **Arrow functions** in ES6 is a shorter way to write functions and they do not create their own **this**. They are used for processing array items and calculations.

### 4. How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
- **Destructing** can take values out of arrays or objects and put them into variables, so we donâ€™t have to access each item or property one by one.

### 5. Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
- **Template literals** make strings using backticks, it puts variables directly inside. It can write multiple lines which is easier than **string concatenation**. Because **string concatenation** joins two or more strings together using the sign.
